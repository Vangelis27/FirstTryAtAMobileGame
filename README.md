# FirstTryAtAMobileGame

First attempt at making an incremental game using GDScript in the Godot Engine.
This is a solo project aimed at getting more experienced at coding and making games.
I picked the Godot Engine because it is probalby on of the easiest engine for beginners and it uses GDScript, a language that is almost the same as python which i have previously tried to learn. 
As a template for the game I am using the most popular game of this genre, Adventure Capitalist.
The theme of the game is based around food and more specificly around sausages, as they are my favorite type of food.
For those who happen to stumble across this repository any tips or any contributions would be appreciated as long as you explain how it works and how it would help the project.
My aim for this project is to work at least 2 hours a day on this project.
